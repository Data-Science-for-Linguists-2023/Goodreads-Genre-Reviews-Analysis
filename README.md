### What's the Story?: Linguistic Variation in Goodreads Reviews by Genre

I plan to examine the text of public Goodreads reviews on books from different genres (young adult, mystery, fantasy, biography, etc.) and see if the way these reviewers use language differs based on the genre they are reading/reviewing. Which genre's readers write the longest reviews? What topics or words do they discuss most often for each genre? Is there a difference in sentiment in the language used when reviewing one genre vs. another? Through this project, I hope to explore all these questions and more.
