4539,"Luther Von Wolfenberg along with his brothers have spent months travelling down from Germany to Italy to claim land in the name of their Holy Roman Emperor . None of them really want to be there but must do their sworn service. Lute has turned out to be a better soldier than he expected and has risen in the ranks. 
 Francesca di Cammarata is in the wrong place at the wrong time. She has taken shelter in a town that is just going to be over run by her uncle's enemies. She could be in terrible danger if the conquering army find out who she is. 
 This is a historical adventure romance. It's part of a series (Family saga) but easily read as a stand alone. Our hero is normally a happy go lucky man, but war has made him grow up fast. The woman who is the first to really stir him is one he cannot have. Our heroine is a very brave young woman with a talent for healing that has changed her life more than once. 
 A fascinating insight into the ways of war, life and death in 1137AD. Our author has a way of making you really relate to her characters and understand the difficulties they face. A really enjoyable read.",5,Courageous Heart (The Von Wolfenberg Dynasty #2),Anna Markland,romance,"{'history, historical fiction, biography': 7, 'romance': 4, 'fiction': 1}",eng,,,4.38,91,93f873217540ff8e5ed1cdaba64b8d8b
4326,"We really enjoyed this nature type storybook for children. Three baby owls wake up to find their Momma has gone off... The two older ones try and stay positive saying things like she'll come back and she's out looking for food etc. but the baby always says ""I want my Momma"" They get scared but then they all close their eyes and wish really hard and Momma comes back just like they knew she would. Illustrations make this storybook, and the repetitive lines make it an easier read for beginning readers.",4,Owl Babies,Martin Waddell,children,"{'children': 750, 'fiction': 42, 'fantasy, paranormal': 4}",en-GB,25,2002,4.19,11590,751efd615712748ea54bd36da6e521aa

4963,"I listened to the audio and thought the narrator did a decent job. It's not uncommon in the LGBT genre to read about men in womens clothes either due to being a drag queen or trans, but I liked that the gender swap was just due to the character hiding from his father. I liked the moment of surprise when it's revealed that not all is as it seems.",5,Taylor Maid,Tara Lain,romance,"{'romance': 56, 'fiction': 2}",eng,218,2016,3.7,444,5a74c90525af7dd783517c94025ffb17
1140,"Finally getting around to ""finishing"" the series by redoing books 1 and 2 then starting 3. 
 Plus side: the beautiful illustrations! 
 Less of a plus: Everyone looks really similar behind the fantasy. I presume Barker gets better at painting. 
 Plus side: exciting story! 
 Minus side: lots of running. Lots and lots of running. Not my favorite plot element.",4,"Abarat (Abarat, #1)",Clive Barker,fantasy_paranormal,"{'fantasy, paranormal': 1663, 'young-adult': 567, 'fiction': 342, 'children': 95, 'comics, graphic': 8}",en-US,393,,4.08,20790,1609f345b940415ddf3037c3f8d85965
