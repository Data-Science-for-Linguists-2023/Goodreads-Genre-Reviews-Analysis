I fell in love with Ebert's blog a couple of years ago and learned his best writing had nothing to do with movies. I bought the book as soon as it came out, but got stuck about halfway through. 
 I'm 28, but I like to pretend that I can keep up with any and all boomer references. The truth is that this book was so steeped in them that at times it was hard for me to follow. I've watched a lot of movies from the 60s and 70s, but I simply could not keep up with all the actors and screenwriters and so forth. I had usually watched at least one film of the directors he profiled, but I wasn't familiar enough with their oeuvre to fully appreciate the scenes and interviews he described. I found myself frequently skimming around the middle of the book. 
 I thought the last 10 or so chapters were the strongest, though many were very familiar since they were pulled almost word-for-word from previous blog posts (some of which I'd read 3 or 4 times before I even picked up the book). 
 Still, all in all, the book was moving and memorable, and I'm glad I read it. Ebert writes about difficult and unpleasant times with frankness and sincerity, but through it all he remains optimistic and kind.",Tue Nov 22 11:16:11 -0800 2011,Tue Nov 22 11:41:27 -0800 2011,Tue Nov 22 00:00:00 -0800 2011,,2,1
