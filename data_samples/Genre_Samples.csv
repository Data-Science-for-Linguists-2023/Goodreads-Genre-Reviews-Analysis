We knew all the songs and attempted to do the dance moves too. I remember we used to get trouble for jumping off the sofa too. When I found out that Cats was based off of poems, I really wanted to read them. I asked for the book for Christmas one year and I read them all that day. The poems are beautifully written and actually tell stories, whereas some poems are just descriptions. I have no idea how T.S, Eliot came up with so creative and brilliant with something as familiar as the family cat. Eliot is a great writer and I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a break from all the intense, sophisticated poems/books they are usually reading.

 ""Sherlock Holmes died fighting Professor Moriarty in the Reichenbach Falls. 
 At least, that's what the press claims. 
 However, Holmes is alive and well and taking advantage of his presumed death to travel the globe. 
 Unfortunately, Holmes's plans are thwarted when a plague of vampirism haunts Britain. 
 This book collects Sherlock Holmes and the Vampires of London Volumes 1 and 2, originally created by French publisher Soleil."" - Darkhorse Comics 
 When I received this copy of ""Sherlock Holmes and the Vampires of London"" I was Ecstatic! The cover art was awesome and it was about two of my favorite things, Sherlock Holmes and Vampires. I couldn't wait to dive into this! 
 Unfortunately, that is where my excitement ended. The story takes place a month after Sherlock Holmes supposed death in his battle with Professor Moriarty. Sherlock's plan to stay hidden and out of site are ruined when on a trip with his brother Mycroft, they stumble on the presence of vampires. That is about as much of Sherlock's character that comes through the book. I can't even tell you the story really because nothing and I mean nothing stuck with me after reading it. I never, ever got the sense of Sherlock Holmes anywhere in this graphic novel, nor any real sense of mystery or crime. It was just Sherlock somehow battling vampires that should have had absolutely no trouble snuffing him out in a fight, but somehow always surviving and holding his own against supernatural, super powerful, blazingly fast creatures. 
 The cover art is awesome and it truly made me excited to read this but everything else feel completely flat for me. I tried telling myself that ""it's a graphic novel, it would be hard to translate mystery, details, emotion"" but then I remembered reading DC Comic's ""Identity Crisis"" and realized that was a load of crap. I know it's unfair to compare the two as ""Identity Crisis"" had popular mystery author Brad Meltzer writing it right? Yeah....no. The standard was set that day and there is more than enough talent out there to create a great story in a graphic novel. 
 That being said, it wasn't a horrible story, it just didn't grip me for feel anything like Sherlock Holmes to me. It was easy enough to follow but I felt no sense of tension, stakes or compassion for any of the characters. 
 As far as the vampires go, it's hard to know what to expect anymore as there are so many different versions these days. This was the more classic version which I personally prefer, but again I didn't find anything that portrayed their dominance, calm confidence or sexuality. There was definitely a presence of their physical prowess but somehow that was lost on me as easily as Sherlock was able to defend himself. I know it, wouldn't do to kill of the main character, but this would have a been a great opportunity to build around the experience and beguiling nature of a vampire that had lived so many years of experience. Another chance to showcase Sherlock's intellect in a battle of wits over strength in something more suitable for this sort of story as apposed to trying to make it feel like an action movie. 
 Maybe I expected to much and hoped to have at least a gripping premise or some sort of interesting plot or mystery but I didn't find it here. This may be a must have for serious Sherlock Holmes fans that have to collect everything about him, but if you are looking for a great story inside a graphic novel, I would have to say pass on this one. 
 That artwork is good, cover is great, story is lacking so I am giving it 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Thu Dec 05 10:44:25 -0800 2013,Thu Dec 05 10:45:15 -0800 2013,Tue Nov 05 00:00:00 -0800 2013,,0,0

 This clearly takes place at an earlier time rather than continuing from Skin Game. In fact, this clearly takes place prior to Ghost Story. Thomas is in his own apartment but Harry and Murphy still have some shaky ground between them. 
 So far, in this comic we have, Harry of course (and we see Mouse in one strip), Molly, Murphy, Thomas and Butters. I won't give anything away but I do look forward to reading the rest as we wait for the next novel.",Thu Apr 21 07:44:00 -0700 2016,Thu Apr 21 07:59:28 -0700 2016,Thu Apr 21 07:59:28 -0700 2016,Thu Apr 21 00:00:00 -0700 2016,0,0

I first stumbled upon a partial fan translation a few years back and have been going crazy trying to find more. I was over the moon when I saw that it was getting an official English translation and bought it the second it went up on Akadot. 
 The first volume has a lot of background and character establishment. Not a whole lot happens in the first volume but we do learn a lot about the personalities of our main characters Yuto and Dick (and really, I wish he had a different name). I can't wait for the next volume! 
 The illustrations are incredible. It is absolutely beautiful. 
 The manga is set in a prison so violence is inevitable. This is a little bit like a yaoi manga version of HBO's Oz. I'm not sure just how plausible the cons background stories are but hey, if you're looking for hyper realism why are you reading yaoi manga? 
 I'm a huge Saki Aida fan and I am hoping beyond hope that they will choose to translate the novel as well. 
 If you like sunshine and puppies then you probably shouldn't pick up a book that takes place in a prison but if you enjoy a bit of violence and some beautiful art, give this a try!",Mon Mar 03 17:45:56 -0800 2014,Mon Mar 03 17:54:11 -0800 2014,Sat Mar 01 00:00:00 -0800 2014,Sat Mar 01 00:00:00 -0800 2014,1,0

 I've always been a fan of Batman. Why? Because he's not Superman. He's darker. He's badder. He's an anti-hero superhero. 
 I recently discovered that Batman has had a history of abusive behaviour towards Robin. On my quest to hunt down all images I could find of Batman smacking Robin around or otherwise being a jerk to him I stumbled on to ""All Star Batman and Robin"". A ha, thought I, if anything has Batman abusing Robin, it'll be this. Frank Miller you say? I believe at this point I was the one cackling. 
 It was a very Sin City take on Batman, I'll give you that. I could hear Mickey Rourke in my head as I read through the narration. Batman is a little (maybe a lot) crazy. It actually makes sense. It makes sense that a man, who was just a child when his parents were murdered right in front of his eyes, went a little crazy. 
 If you want sunshine and puppies and warm hugs this isn't for you. If you're looking for violence then you've found it. 
 There are some ""issues"" that have been brought up. People talk about it being sexist, frankly it seems more like realistic to me but maybe that's the problem. We don't want to acknowledge that the world is not that different from Gotham and even our heroes turn out to be not so nice. 
 Homophobic? Again, realistic. Don't believe me? Go listen to a bunch of young boys talk some time and suddenly Robin calling the Batmobile ""queer"" doesn't seem so far fetched. 
 Again, one of the reasons I've always loved Batman is because it's a little more realistic than some of the others. No flying man shooting lasers and becoming a weakling whenever someone waves a glowing rock at him. (Sorry I don't really hate Superman, truly I don't.) Batman is a guy who has trained himself to fight, who has come up with inventions to help him win his fights and who doesn't always do the right thing because he's only human. 
 Just because I enjoy the book (or anyone reading it enjoys it) doesn't mean we condone the behaviour of the characters within. But I have a surprise for you because they're fictional, they aren't real, Batman doesn't actually exist and I'm able to take it for what it is, entertainment. 
 This is what I like when it comes to comics, no, not child abuse, but that it's not for kids. Not at all. This is for adults. It's not nice. It's not G rated. It's not PG. It shouldn't be. 
 Before I go I want to mention the art. That anyone would bash on the art blows my mind. Honestly, I don't get it. The art is stellar. It's not even necessarily what I like but that doesn't diminish how fantastic it is. And someone mentioned Batman getting facial hair when he didn't have it when he started out his night. Some men grow facial hair faster than others. I know men who shave more than once a day because of it. It's really not unrealistic but I guess some folks love to nitpick. 
 This book isn't for the faint of heart or those who like their superheroes with milk and cookies. But for the rest of you, it's worth checking out. I mean really, who doesn't want to see a superhero smacking around a 12 year old boy he's just kidnapped?!",Wed Apr 03 12:37:48 -0700 2013,Wed Apr 03 13:03:36 -0700 2013,Wed Apr 03 13:03:36 -0700 2013,,0,0
